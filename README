1. Configure the proxy setting in browser. We recommend using firefox. In the setting -> advance -> network set the proxy configuration to "Manual configuration". Set the HTTP proxy to localhost and port to the port you like. (Do not use the system reserved port)

2. Run the server.py under root priviledge. (By default, server will save the http responses in the Proxy/server_data/request_count#/proxy_data#)

3. Run the client.py under root prigiledge with the command python client.py <portnumber>. (By default, server will save the http request in the Proxy/client_data/request#)
